# Airline Reservation Project

This project aimed to simulate the airline booking process:

A software that performs online reservation tasks for an airline company. Some functions of the software
include: reserve, cancel, review, change, and generate some type of reports for the managers. The confirmation 
email should also be sent to the traveler.
